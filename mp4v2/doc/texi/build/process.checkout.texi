@section Checkout Sources

Checkout sources from the project's Git repository.

Sources are checked out from either the trunk, release or a branch. This document was generated from one of those, and for example purposes, we will use exactly the same URL which used to create the distribution which contains this document.

If you are a project member, then you may add the appropriate login/password information as needed.

@example
@COMMANDcheckout{}
@end example

It is recommended to use Git 2.17.0 or higher.
Lower versions might work.
